## Project Overview

Catch the Ant is a SwiftUI game designed to test and improve your reaction time. Once the game starts, players must remain alert. A randomized "Wait for it..." screen appears, followed by several bugs crawling across the screen-only one of them is the ant. Tapping the ant wins the game, but tapping the wrong bug results in a loss.

The goal is simple: **spot the ant, tap it fast, and beat your high score!** Perfect for casual play or competitive friends trying to out-react each other.
